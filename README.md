# Dental Clinics Database Project
## Project Description
This project involves designing a database to manage dental clinics, patients, professionals, receptionists, appointments, bills and treatments. A simple user-interface was designed in PHP to interact with the database.

## Project Requirements
A company owns a network of dental clinics and you need to design a database for them. Patients can make appointments to see a dentist at a clinic. Sometimes patients make appointments without knowing which dentist they are going to see. Dentists assign some treatments to be done on the patient. The treatments can be executed by dentists or by dental assistants. Bills are produced to record how much the patients need to pay for the treatments. One bill can contain the cost of many treatments done in one visit at a clinic. Besides dentists and dental assistants, there are also receptionists responsible for recording appointments and for processing the bill payments.
